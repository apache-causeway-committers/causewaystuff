== Relocated Libraries

[WARNING]
====
Relocated libraries require _Maven_ to build. 

To check them out in your IDE, 
you must first build everything with _Maven_ then 
close/deactivate the relocated library projects in the IDE. 

(At least _Eclipse_ - at the time of writing - 
is unable to make sense of those when opened.)

| tooling-codeassert 
| _Code-Assert_ is a library that allows to assert that the source code of a project satisfies certain rules.

We relocated its packages to `io.github.causewaystuff.tooling.codeassert.*` 
and patched them with support for adoc files, also defining a stable JPMS module name.

See also https://github.com/nidi3/code-assert/pull/47

| _Structurizr_ is a library for system diagram generation.

We relocated its packages to `io.github.causewaystuff.tooling.structurizr.*`
